Procedure to Run the Simulation and Visualise the Result:

1.Import Simulation Files: Begin by importing the simulation folder into MATLAB.

2.Open Simulink Model:

	Navigate to the imported simulation folder.
	Open the Simulink model titled "einspurmodell.mdl".
3.Open MATLAB Script:

	Locate and open the MATLAB script named "Plotting_Bezier_Curve.m".
4.Configure Simulation Settings:

	Within the MATLAB script, specify the desired location for simulation by adjusting the 		value of "C_position", representing the current position of the vehicle.
	For example, to simulate the vehicle's behavior at 100 meters from the starting point, 		set "C_position" to 100.
5.Run the Simulation:

	Execute the MATLAB script to initiate the simulation.
6.Lateral Acceleration Profile:

	Upon running the Simulink model "einspurmodell.mdl", visualize the lateral acceleration 	profile by opening the scope for lateral acceleration (a_y).
